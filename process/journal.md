# The journal of the frog

## What's next? (2025-09-02)

You know what? I should have been writing a journal or at least doing *something* maintain a fix on what I'm trying to do with this thing. I'll check my commits to see if there's anything obvious...

I see some ideas!

- Bullet time/slow-motion... "tongue time"? Could be always on for the sheer glamour and awesomeness of never missing? Could be something you charge up and can use while pressing a special key? (That would be tricky for mobile.) Could be some kind of power-up that lasts for a while? Main thing would be just to implement it and think about the way it's acted out later on...
- Mutating frog... when I wrote the eyes function it became apparent I could add more eyes... maybe just randomly within the circle of the frog or som other constrained area? That implied maybe a mutant/radioactive fly that would trigger that? Would have a lot of implications though, like you'd have to have a way to track how many eyes the frog has and where they are so that you can draw it each frame? Sounds like work!
- Tongue targeting... earlier on I can see I had the idea that *where* you click is where the tongue eventually goes to, even if you move the frog around after launch... which is a totally different experience because you'd be predicting the fly's trajectory and then launching and hoping?
- Tongue adjust... kind of already have this because you can move the frog around while the tongue's going out.... what if control switched to the tongue instead? Can't just match mouseX though because I think that would be too easy? Would slide towards where the cursor/finger is? Hmmm, confusing?

Anyway, those are some things I could do. And there are probably millions more right?
